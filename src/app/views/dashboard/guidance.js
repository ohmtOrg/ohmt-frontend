The accessors conducting the self-assessment assigns scores into the OHMT scoring grid , by assigning a score  to each of the 26 sub-categories.Based on the scores entered into the OHMT scoring grid, graphs highlighting the institutionalization and operationalization systemâ€™s strengths and weaknesses are automatically generated. These outputs become the basis from which guidance for improvement are proposed.",
