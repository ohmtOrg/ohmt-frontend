      description: 'The One Health Monitoring Tool (OHMT) is built around drivers to institutionalize and operationalize One Health. It is a tool that is used to assess progress made, and identify gaps on OH implementation at the local, national, and regional levels. The tool is intended to be used for collecting semi-quantitative data, that is fed into a digital system which generates visuals allowing for a comprehensive overview of operational gaps. The tool also serves as toolkit to facilitate users identify existing OH tools, guidelines, initiatives, and other existing resources promoting multisectoral and multidisciplinary collaboration that can be used for reference to address identified OH gaps.',

Category (6): Areas of focus generated in relation to circumstances that form the backdrop for each of the given domain. Sub-Category (26): Specific areas which enable the self-assessment to evaluate achievements against specific attributes related to each category.',

The scoring scale prompts specific question(s) related to each statement that need to be read and understood prior to selection of the appropriate score. The scores are automatically calculated and visuals (spider web diagram, bar graphs etc.) depicting operational strengths and gaps for each domain are automatically generated. The outputs generated by the OHMT system will be the basis from which guidance for improvements are proposed in reference to the toolkit. 1- No initiative is in place for implementing OH 2- Plans are in place to develop initiatives that will improve OH 3- OH implementation is ongoing, but initiatives/activities are not yet endorsed by relevant competent authorities 4- OH implementation is ongoing, and initiatives/activities are endorsed by relevant competent authorities",
